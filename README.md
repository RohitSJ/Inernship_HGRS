A This work aims to explain a new technique to hand gesture detection that offers a natural, creative, and contemporary way of nonverbal communication, with many applications in sign language and human-computer interaction. The user's gesture is captured by a single camera in this arrangement, and the hand image is used as input by the suggested algorithm. Tested on 780 photos, the constructed algorithm demonstrates its efficiency compared to previous methods with an approximate 97% recognition rate at an average elapsed time of 2.76 seconds.
